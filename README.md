# React Template

> An alterative to building an empty React app via create-react-app, react-template creates a basic React project with Webpack, Babel, Typescript, Eslint, Prettier, and GitHooks ensuring no future need to eject and standardizing the development process.

## Installation

Clone the repository.
Run:

```sh
$ cd react-template
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```

The app should launch in a browser, but if it does not, navigate to: http://localhost:3000/

At this point you are ready to begin building your own React app.
